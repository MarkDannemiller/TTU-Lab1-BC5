# README

This section contains an example notebook by 2 of our group members.  One group member did his entire notebook through OneNote, and another did it in a physical notebook and scanned it to a pdf.  There are many ways to write you project lab notebook, and you can feel free to use ours as an example.  This section is also useful for anyone who is interested in our though process throughout the process of creating the Nautilus platform.
