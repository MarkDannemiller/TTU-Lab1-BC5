### Power Point Presentation

The above presentation is the Nautilus team's interim presentation for Spring 2023.  The videos have been removed due to the file size being too large.  You can use the presentation as a template for your own. \

We started the year with a black background presentation template, and moved to light mode for several reasons.
1. White backgrounds are cleaner and easier to see in a room by other people
2. White background presenations can be printed out to paper format for an in-person presentation without a projector.  Dr. Clark, our professor, gave a different "curve ball," or challenge, to use each week.  One week, we were given a no projector curve ball.  Our team printed our week's presentation (which was in black) onto paper to hand out to the class.  This was a major waste of ink and luckily we did not have to eat that ink cost.  For the sake of your printer and for the department's, there is a higher level of utility in a light-mode presentation.
3. Most images are built for light mode graphics.  While a dark mode application looks fine on a white presentation background, white background images look worse in a dark mode presentation.

The template that we have provided above was the final version of our PowerPoints.  It is not flashy, but was built to best display the content, the name of the presenter, and the page number in a manner clearly visible to the audience.
