# TTU-Lab1-BC5
Robotics Project Lab 1 repository for Boat Crew 5 (Team 5).  Here is a compilation of our code and resources that we are using as well as the progress of our Wiki to explain the design process and usage of resources distributed to other teams.\

## Note on These Resources
As time passes, these tutorials will become out of date and increasingly lose their relevance.  The professors of the course have little incentive to provide resources such as these (though they usually provide some), and every semester it is the students that are experts on the tools and resources that future students will need to be successful in the course.  If you have resources, tips, or want to make a guide for this repository, I would very much appreciate that!  There are many ways to do so, and I am more than happy to grant access to anyone that wants to contribute here.  Alternatively, you can email me [mdannemi@ttu.edu](mailto:mdannemi@ttu.edu) and I can do a writeup over anything that is missing from these materials.
