Quick note:

The [mini project sources](https://github.com/MarkDannemiller/TTU-Lab1-BC5/tree/main/Nautilus%20Code/Mini_Project.srcs/sources_1/new) offer a good setup for the requirements of the motor control code.  I would recommend also looking at the [Nautilus_L1 sources](https://github.com/MarkDannemiller/TTU-Lab1-BC5/tree/main/Nautilus%20Code/Nautilus_L1.srcs/sources_1/new) as that code has much better commments and was changed to better fit the final project.

If you are trying to use the XADC for software current overflow, check the two links that I have posted for the XADC Resources in the Wiki/home page.
